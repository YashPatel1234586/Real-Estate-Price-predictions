# Dragon Real Estate - Price Predictor

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, and other market factors. The model uses machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and make accurate price estimations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model training and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding and analysis.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine Learning model training and evaluation
- Price prediction for new real estate listings

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dragon-real-estate.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd dragon-real-estate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
